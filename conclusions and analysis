Based on the calculations, several key conclusions can be drawn such as Higher Spending Does Not Correlate with Better Performance: Schools with lower per-student budgets (below $585) tend to have higher average scores and passing percentages compared to schools with higher spending ranges. 

This suggests that higher spending does not necessarily result in better academic performance. In addition Smaller Schools are More Conducive to Success: Smaller schools (less than 1000 students) tend to have higher average scores and passing percentages compared to larger schools. This indicates that smaller school sizes may provide a more conducive environment for student success. Another conclusion that we are able to come to is that Charter schools generally outperform district schools across all key performance metrics, indicating that the type of school can significantly impact student performance.

The anaylsis shows important insights into the relationships between school spending, size, type, and academic performance. Lower spending and smaller school sizes are associated with better academic outcomes, while charter schools tend to outperform district schools. These findings can inform decisions regarding resource allocation, school management, and educational strategies to enhance student performance.
